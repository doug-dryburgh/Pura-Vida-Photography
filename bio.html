                        <h3>Photography</h3>
                        <p>Photography began as a hobby almost a decade ago. I became interested after making a friend who was very passionate about it. Over time I learned a lot from him and was enthusiastic enough to justify buying my first real camera. Early on I sold a couple of my landscape prints and that was the beginning of the end. I had more than enough to motivate me to continue practicing and refining my skills.</p>
                        <p>I’ve worked in many different areas since then. I began by selling my landscape prints but quickly became interested in portraiture. Working with people proved to be an area I excelled in and a place I think I have an especially keen eye. More recently I've also been involved with event photography and even taught a weekly photography workshop while living in London.</p>
                        <h3>Me</h3>
                        <p>I'm an avid traveller and even though it's the heaviest thing in my bag my camera always comes with me! I feel pretty lucky to have visited and photographed so many exotic locations! My attitude is that life is one long opportunity to learn things. In my spare time you’ll find me practicing Spanish, learning to code or reading about psychology, to name a few pursuits. When this doesn't completely burn me out I like mainstream things too! Snowboarding, classic and 90's alt rock, and my hockey team the Vancouver Canucks all keep me busy! Other notable hobbies: coffee, bacon. Bacon is a hobby right?</p>
                        <h3>Why Pura Vida?</h3>
                        <p>Pura Vida is a popular phrase in Costa Rica which essentially means "enjoying life." My first trip was to Costa Rica; it was my first step away from a mundane life into a place where I realized I was far more able to achieve my dreams than I ever thought possible. The phrase has become an important mantra and reminder to me--to always be enjoying life!</p>
