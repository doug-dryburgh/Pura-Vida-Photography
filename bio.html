                        <h3>Photography</h3>
                        <p>Photography began as a hobby almost a decade ago. I became interested after making a friend who was very passionate about it. Over time I learned enough from him and was enthusiastic enough to justify buying my first real camera. Early on I sold a couple of my landscape prints and that was enough to propel me to continue practicing and improving.</p>
                        <p>Over the years I have worked in many different areas. I began with landscapes but quickly became interested in portraiture. Working with people is a big favourite of mine and an area I think I have an especially keen eye for. More recently I've also been involved with event photography and even taught a weekly photography workshop while living in London, England.</p>
                        <h3>Me</h3>
                        <p>I'm an avid traveller and even though it's the heaviest thing in my bag my camera always comes with me! I feel pretty lucky to have visited so many exotic locations and have the opportunity to photograph them! My attitude is that life is one long opportunity to learn things. In my spare time I'll be practicing Spanish, learning to code or reading about psychology to name a few. When this doesn't completely burn me out I like mainstream things too! Snowboarding, classic and 90's alt rock, and my hockey team the Vancouver Canucks all keep me busy! Other things I enjoy: beer, coffee, bacon.</p>
                        <h3>Why Pura Vida?</h3>
                        <p>Pura Vida is a popular phrase in Costa Rica which essentially means "enjoying life." Costa Rica was my first step from a mundane life into a place where I realized I was far more confident and able to achieve my dreams than I ever thought possible. It's become an important mantra for me and reminder--to always be enjoying life!</p>
